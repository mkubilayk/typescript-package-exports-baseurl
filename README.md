# Reproduction for microsoft/TypeScript#52950

https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/52950

First build the producer:

```sh
npm install
npx tsc -p packages/producer-with-package-exports
```

Test the consumer without `baseUrl`:

```sh
npx tsc -p packages/consumer-without-baseurl
# all imports are resolved correctly, works as expected âœ…
```

Test the consumer with `baseUrl`:

```sh
npx tsc -p packages/consumer-with-baseurl
# fails to resolve the import using package exports ðŸ’¥
```

Get the resolution trace:

```sh
npx tsc -p packages/consumer-with-baseurl --traceResolution
```

âœ… Good (`producer-with-package-exports`):
