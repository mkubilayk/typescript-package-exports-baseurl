Title: Using `baseUrl` breaks package exports lookup

# Bug Report

A producer package exposes multiple entrypoint using [Node's package exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points). When this package is consumed using the following compiler options, TypeScript fails to resolve the entry points.

```jsonc
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "moduleResolution": "node16",
        "baseUrl": "/path/to/modules/store",
    }
}
```

This problem doesn't happen when `baseUrl` is absent -- relying on the default lookup behavior.

### üîé Search Terms

`baseUrl`, base url, package exports, module resolution


### üïó Version & Regression Information

This is the behavior in every version I tried: 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9. I was unable to test this on prior versions because `"node16"` module resolution was first introduced in 4.7.

### üíª Code

Please see the full code and reproduction steps in the repo but the most relevant bits are as follows.

Producer:

```jsonc
{
    "name": "producer-with-package-exports",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "out/index.js",
    "types": "out/index.d.ts",
    "exports": {
        ".": {
            "types": "./out/index.d.ts",
            "require": "./out/index.js"
        },
        "./entrypoint-a": {
            "types": "./out/entrypoint-a.d.ts",
            "require": "./out/entrypoint-a.js"
        }
    }
}
```

Consumer (targetting `"commonjs"`):

```ts
import { something } from "producer-with-package-exports";
import { somethingElse } from "producer-with-package-exports/entrypoint-a";
//                            ^
// Cannot find module 'producer-with-package-exports/entrypoint-a' or its corresponding type declarations. ts(2307)
```

### üôÅ Actual behavior

When using the `baseUrl` compiler option in the consumer `"producer-with-package-exports/entrypoint-a"` fails to resolve:

```ts
import { somethingElse } from "producer-with-package-exports/entrypoint-a";
//                            ^
// Cannot find module 'producer-with-package-exports/entrypoint-a' or its corresponding type declarations. ts(2307)
```

### üôÇ Expected behavior

Using `baseUrl` should not stop TypeScript from looking at package exports in the producer. So `"producer-with-package-exports/entrypoint-a"` should be resolved correctly -- matching the behaviour when `baseUrl` is not present.

I have also verified the producer package using Andrew Branch's https://arethetypeswrong.github.io (üíô) and got the following report as expected:
